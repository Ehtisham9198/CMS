### **Features**  
- **File Movement Workflow**: Digitally handle file approvals, rejections, and forwarding between departments and users.  
- **Hierarchical Tracking**: Track the file's journey through departments with complete visibility.  
- **Approval System**: Enable users to approve, reject, or return files with remarks for clarity.  
- **User Authentication**: Secure user sessions to maintain data integrity and prevent unauthorized access.  
- **Multi-Role Support**: Tailored functionality for faculty, staff, and administrators, addressing diverse needs.  
- **Additional Features**: Includes a digital notice board, meeting scheduler, and announcements for enhanced utility.

### **Tech Stack**  
- **Frontend**: React.js for dynamic, responsive user interfaces.  
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express.js for robust server-side logic.  
- **Database**: PostgreSQL for structured and secure data storage.
- **PDF Generation**: Libraries like pdfkit for converting files and actions into PDF format.
- **Deployment**: Hosted on a college-provided virtual machine.

### **Setup Instructions**  

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Ehtisham9198/CampusFlow.git
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**  
   For the backend:  
   ```bash
   cd backend  
   npm install  
   ```

   For the frontend:  
   ```bash
   cd frontend  
   npm install  
   ```

3. **Configure Environment Variables**  
   Create a `.env` file in the `backend` directory with the following keys:  
   ```env
   DATABASE_URL=your_postgres_database_url
   SESSION_SECRET=your_secret_key
   ```

4. **Run the Application**  
   - Start the backend server:  
     ```bash
     cd backend  
     npm start  
     ```  
   - Start the frontend:  
     ```bash
     cd frontend  
     npm start  
     ```  

5. **Access the Application**  
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to access the platform.

### **How It Works**  
1. **Login**: Users authenticate using secure credentials.  
2. **File Upload**: Files are uploaded and assigned a unique identifier for tracking.  
3. **Action Selection**: Users choose actions (approve, reject, forward) and provide remarks.  
4. **Tracking**: Administrators and users can track file movements in real-time.  
5. **Notifications**: Key actions trigger notifications to the relevant stakeholders.
